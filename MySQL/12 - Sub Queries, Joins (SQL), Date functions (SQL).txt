Window Function:
- Window function are analytical function in SQL
- Window function lets you perform calculation that required to create sub queries.

Syntax :

func(col1) over(partition by .... order by...)

3 types of window function


1. Aggregate  window functions

sum(col1)  over(partition by ... Order by ...)
avg(col1) over(partition by ...order by...)


2. Value window functions:

lead(col1)   over(partition by ... order by...)
lag(col1)     over(partition by ... order by ...)
  
3. Rank Window Functions

row_number()  over(partition by ... order by ...)
rank()    over(partition by ... order by ...)
dense_rank()  over(partition by ... order by ...)


Note :   In all of this queries partitional clause remains optional.

select *, row_number() over(order by name) as rnum from t10;

when we use row_number() as funtion my output will be sequencial series.


select *, rank() over(order by name) as rank from t10;

repeats for duplicate value and is not sequencial

select *,dense_rank() over(order by name) as drank from t10;

dense_rank also repeats for same values but its sequential
